# ServerlessBasicsWorkshop

During the workshop you will get familiar with different approaches to serverless in Azure, AWS and Google Cloud Platform (aka GCP). We will pass through functions, containers and storage to have a kind of full solution for hosting (frontend and backend). We won't discuss load balancers and CDNs as those are separate topics.

## Required components
* Docker
* [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/)
* **Accounts in Azure, AWS and Google Cloud Platform**
* Good mood
* Laptop, calculator or any other device when you can run the code will be useful
